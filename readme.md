But if I try\ntalking to her, she'll just get mad at me again. I don't know what to\ndo. I think you're the only person that she'll listen to. I don't know\nwhy. But please try to do something. Maybe you can convince her to talk\nto a therapist.\n\nI've always wanted to try being better friends with Yuri, and\nit really hurts me to see this happening. I know I'm going to hate\nmyself later for admitting that, but right now I don't care. I just feel\nso helpless. So please see if you can do something to help. I don't\nwant anything bad to happen to her. I'll make you cupcakes if I have to.\nJust please try to do something.\n\nAs for Monika... I don't know why, but she's been really dismissive about this. It's like she just wants us to ignore it. So I'm mad at her right now, and that's why I'm coming to you about this. DON'T LET HER KNOW I WROTE THIS!!!! Just pretend like I gave you a really good poem, okay? I'm counting on you. Thanks for reading.",
