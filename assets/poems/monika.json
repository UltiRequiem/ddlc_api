I can't see. I reel, blind, like a film left out in the sun.\nBut it's too late. My retinas.\nAlready scorched with a permanent copy of the meaningless image.\nIt's just a little hole. It wasn't too bright.\nIt was too deep.\nStretching forever into everything.\nA hole of infinite choices.\nI realize now, that I wasn't looking in.\nI was looking out.\nAnd he, on the other side, was looking in."

Are they talking?\nOr are they simply poems on flat sheets of paper,\nThe sound of frantic scrawling playing tricks on my ears?\nThe room begins to crinkle.\nClosing in on me.\nThe air I breathe dissipate before it reaches my lungs.\nI panic. There must be a way out.\nIt's right there. He's right there.\n\nSwallowing my fears, I brandish my pen."
